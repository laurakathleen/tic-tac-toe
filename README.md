#Tic Tac Toe Game

I created a tic-tac-toe game that enables two players to use their assigned x and o marks to try and beat out their opponent.

###Technologies Used:
  * HTML
  * CSS
  * Javascript
  * jQuery

### The Basics:
* Choose a player 1 and a player 2.   
* Player one goes first and clicks a box to mark with an x  
* Player two follows and clicks a box of their choosing.
* The gameboard will know if the game ends in a tie or a win.
* After each game is complete, hit the 'reset' button to start a new game.
